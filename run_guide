Step1: Run check-GPU.py to check whether tensorflow can accept your GPU.
       If returns True means tensorflow can accept your GPU, otherwise you can only use CPU.
       You can check developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus to ensure whether your GPU is supported.
       And install you GPU driver through www.nvidia.com/drivers
       Then install CUDA v10.0


Step2: Download Yolov3 weights files from https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
       Save it in /weights folder

Step3: Convert a yolo model to a tensorflow format.
       Run convert.py in terminal and you should see message:
       "weights loaded", "sanity check passed", "weights saved" to confirm that the model is converted successfully.
       And you should see: checkpoint, yolov3.tf.index, yolov3.tf.data-00000-of-00001 in /weights folder.

Step4: Put your dataset path in object_tracker.py line42, after "imgfolder="

Step5: Run object_tracker.py
